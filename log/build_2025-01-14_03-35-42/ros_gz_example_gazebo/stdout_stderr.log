[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgz-plugin2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "gz-plugin2", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gz-plugin2" with
  any of the following names:

    gz-plugin2Config.cmake
    gz-plugin2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gz-plugin2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gz-plugin2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "gz-plugin2" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
